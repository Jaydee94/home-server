# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A fully automated, GitOps-driven home server. Ansible provisions the host (Ubuntu 26.04 LTS); k3s runs Kubernetes; ArgoCD continuously syncs everything under `argocd/apps/` to the cluster; Tailscale provides VPN access with no public ports exposed.

## Commands

```bash
make deps           # Install required Ansible Galaxy collections
make ping           # Verify Ansible can reach the server
make check          # Dry-run the full playbook (no changes applied)
make install        # Provision the home server end-to-end

# Run individual roles only
make common         # Base OS, firewall, packages
make tailscale      # VPN role
make k3s            # Kubernetes + Helm role
make argocd         # GitOps controller role
make semaphore      # Bootstrap Semaphore Secret on the home-server
make semaphore-targets  # Push Semaphore SSH key to all managed targets

make lint           # yamllint + ansible-lint + helm lint
make vault-edit     # Edit vault-encrypted vars (ansible/group_vars/all.yml)
```

## Architecture

```
Ansible (provisioning)
  └── ansible/site.yml          ← entry point; roles run in this order:
        common → dnsmasq → tailscale → k3s → argocd → semaphore_secrets
  └── ansible/group_vars/all.yml ← ALL configuration knobs; vault-encrypted secrets live here
  └── ansible/inventory/hosts.yml ← server address

k3s (Kubernetes, single-node)
  └── bundles Traefik v2 (ingress), CoreDNS, local-path-provisioner, metrics-server

ArgoCD (GitOps)
  └── argocd/bootstrap/root-applicationset.yaml
        ← discovers every directory under argocd/apps/* automatically
        ← each directory becomes an ArgoCD Application named after the folder,
           deployed into a namespace of the same name
        ← auto-syncs with prune + selfHeal on every push to main
  └── argocd/apps/<name>/      ← plain Kubernetes YAML, kustomize, OR a Helm chart
```

### Adding an application

```bash
mkdir -p argocd/apps/my-app
# Add Kubernetes YAML, kustomization.yaml, or a Helm chart (Chart.yaml + values.yaml)
git add argocd/apps/my-app && git commit -m "feat(apps): add my-app" && git push
# ArgoCD picks it up within ~3 minutes; namespace "my-app" is created automatically
```

## Secrets

All secrets are stored in `ansible/group_vars/all.yml` using Ansible Vault. To add or rotate a secret:

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt_string 'the-secret-value' --name 'variable_name'
# paste the resulting `!vault |` block into group_vars/all.yml
make vault-edit  # to open the file directly in your editor
```

The Tailscale auth key (`tailscale_auth_key`) must always be vault-encrypted. Never commit plaintext secrets.

## Lint rules

- `yamllint` config: `.yamllint` — applied to `ansible/` and `argocd/`
- `ansible-lint` config: `.ansible-lint`
- Helm charts are linted with `helm lint`
- `charts/`, `Chart.lock`, and `*.tgz` are git-ignored (vendored chart tarballs are the exception when checked in deliberately, e.g. `headlamp`)

## Key configuration variables (ansible/group_vars/all.yml)

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hostname` | Server hostname |
| `auto_upgrade` | Keep OS + components on latest (default: true) |
| `k3s_channel` / `k3s_version` | Pin or float k3s version |
| `argocd_repo_url` | Git repo ArgoCD syncs from |
| `tailscale_auth_key` | Vault-encrypted WireGuard auth key |

## Networking

No public ports. All remote access is via Tailscale. Traefik handles HTTP/HTTPS ingress within the LAN/Tailnet on ports 80/443. ArgoCD UI is available on NodePorts 30080/30443.
